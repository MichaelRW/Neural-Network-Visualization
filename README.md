# Feedforward neural network's hypothesis space visualization

A neural network can only have an arbitrary but fixed hypothesis space for a certain training dataset. This repository 
visualize the internal parameters of a neural network in dependent with the training data.

### Simple training data with less complex topology

### Advanced training data with no possible way to draw a dividing line between two classes

### Another non-trivial training data set
